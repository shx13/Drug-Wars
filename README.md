# PHP-Wars

PHP framework to easily create 'remakes' based on legendary 1984's game Drugwars, created by John E. Dell. Application is based on Skeletor, my PHP-MVC framework.

By default, it will load the configuration file of a game called Sailor Wars.

To create a new version of the game (or a translation), just go to app/config/ and edit options.php file. There's a second file called options.drugwars.php, it contains the configuration of original 1984 game. If you want to use it, just change the name of the file to options.php.

## Live version:
You can see the live version with the options.drugwars.php file loaded at:

## To be fixed:
CSS needs to be fixed. The game was originally supposed to be as 'monospace' as possible, but it's hard to maintain with different options.php files.
